# COVID-19 Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the spread of COVID-19 using the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model. The SIR model is a compartmental model that divides the population into three compartments: susceptible, infectious, and recovered individuals. By simulating the dynamics of these compartments over time, we can make predictions about the spread of the virus.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

Parameters
total_population: Total population size.
initial_infected: Initial number of infected individuals.
contact_rate: Rate of contact between susceptible and infectious individuals.
recovery_rate: Rate of recovery of infectious individuals.
days_to_predict: Number of days to predict the spread of COVID-19.
You can adjust these parameters in the main.py file to see different scenarios.
